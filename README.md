Developed a real-time automated news categorization system aimed at classifying news articles and detecting emerging trends across various topics. The solution leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, combined with machine learning models such as Naive Bayes/Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Logistic Regression for precise classification. By automating the content categorization process, the system enhances news delivery platforms, allowing users to efficiently discover significant trends and topics of interest. This approach improves user engagement by offering relevant and timely content, ultimately streamlining news management for publishers and improving the user experience.
